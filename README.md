# A_Cut_Above_App

This repository houses the files used to run my Insight project app A Cut Above. The app allows users to search their local area for lung surgeons and see the rating that was assigned to them by my machine learning model based on a prediction of their quality (rate of negative outcomes). The app was built with streamlit and deploys from this repository to heroku. You can try out the app [here](https://cut-above.herokuapp.com).
